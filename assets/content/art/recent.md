### Drawing on Microsoft Paint

For some reason I decided to draw on Microsoft Paint. I saw some cool art on it and downloaded an old Windows XP version of it.

### Team Spiras

I drew a lot of character for a visual novel project I joined. It has been a lot of fun. They are sometimes a bit disorganized, but I like them.
