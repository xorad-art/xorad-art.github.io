# Terms of Service (ToS) for Commissioned Artwork

These Terms of Service (ToS) govern the relationship between myself, Xorad, and any individual or entity seeking to commission artwork (ie). By engaging by my services, the Client agrees to abide by these terms.

## 1. Payment

Payment is done in US dollars (USD), through PayPal or Vgen (for commissions done in the Vgen platform), for any client outside of Mexico.

For clients inside Mexico, Mexican Pesos (MXN), can be sent through SPEI or CoDi.

## 2. Commission Process

The Client shall initiate the commission process by contacting me through any of my social networks, and providing a detailed description of the desired artwork. I shall then provide the Client with:

 1. Price: the total cost of the commission, including taxes and fees.
 2. Estimated Completion Time: From the initiation of work to delivery to the Client.
 3. Any additional condition not outlined in this document.

If the Client agrees, I will begin working on the artwork in at most 2 weeks, depending on my availability. When the artwork is near completion I shall send a final draft or preview of the work done. When the full payment is received I shall provide the client with the full artwork and may send original project files if requested.

### 2.1 Revisions

The Client may request revisions to the artwork during the sketching or early stages of development. These revisions shall be incorporated at no additional charge. After the artwork is near completion, minor adjustments can be agreed to. **Major revisions** or changes in scope may incur additional charges.

## 3. Usage Rights

I keep full ownership and copyright of the commissioned artwork, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing. The Client may use the art for any personal use as long as I'm credited.

Commercial use costs and additional 150% of the base price, at which point the Client may use the artwork for any monetary gain. My artwork **cannot be used** to train AI or make NFTs

## 4. Cancellation and Refunds

If by any reason I am unable to fulfill the commission for any reason, including but not limited to unforeseen circumstances or inability to complete the artwork to satisfactory standards, the Client shall receive a full refund of any payments made.

## 5. Privacy

I shall keep all communications and personal information provided by the Client confidential and shall not disclose such information to third parties without prior consent, except as required by law.

## 6. Acceptance of Terms

By engaging my services, the Client acknowledges that they have read, understood, and agreed to abide by these Terms of Service in their entirety.

### 6.1 Updates

I may modify these terms at any time without prior notice. Any artwork commissioned in the future may abide by different terms.
