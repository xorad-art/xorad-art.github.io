# Welcome to my personal website

## About me

I'm **Xorad**, and I'm an illustrator based in Mexico. I'm passionate about art, coding and sometimes *whatever* my mind decides. I like to come up with things like this website or, just draw people and landscapes.

~~I'm currently studying Computer Systems Engineering at the [National Polytechnic Institute](https://www.ipn.mx/ "IPN on Spanish") at [ESCOM](https://www.escom.ipn.mx/ "Escuela Superior de Cómputo").~~ Doing a Math degree at [UNAM](https://www.unam.mx/)

> Because I get this often, my nickname is pronounced like "Shorad". My mascot is a tardigrade, I find them really cute with their unicelular eyes.

## This site

### Why?

I wanted to have a place to put my **thoughts** and my **projects**.

<!-- I'm not getting rid of this warning for inline html, not worth it -->
> Nowadays people have their <button onclick="toggleContactInfo()" title="Here are mine">socials</button>, but I'm retro like that, why not both?

I also wanted to learn web development, then coded this website from scratch with no previous knowledge of web development, it's a bit rough around the edges, but not because of that I'm not proud of it.

### How?

I'm using the simplest tools when it comes to web development, so, I'm using (almost) raw HTML, CSS and JavaScript. For some quality of life, instead of writing directly in css, I'm using [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/ "A life saving preprocessor") to make it easier to write and maintain.

Most of my notes are done in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/ "A guide if you want to get started") anyways, so, I'm using [Marked.js](https://marked.js.org/ "Their page") to parse markdown files into HTML.

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/ "Hosting for GitHub Repos") has been a lifesaver for hosting this website in a simple way.

### Things to do

There are still **a lot** of things to do, but, I'm working on it. I'm planning to add a blog, and a main page with a list of my projects, but, I'm not in a hurry. For now, the bulk of the development is done, and I should focus on adding content.
