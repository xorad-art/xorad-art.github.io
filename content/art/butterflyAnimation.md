# About that time I decided to animate using watercolors

> **2024/03/08**

A random day during the pandemic I wanted to do something different. Some inspiration struck me remembering that for a job, a long time ago, my mom had to animate silhouettes of a butterfly, so, I thought, why not animate a butterfly using watercolors?

I recently found the original paper with the butterfly drawings in a random folder (a literal folder, not a computer folder) and I thought it would be a good idea to write about it.

## Process

I had no real idea of how, but I had my experience with flipbooks, so, I thought, why not? Searching for references I found a random video of monarch butterflies flying.

I slowly [rotoscoped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotoscoping "Tracing over a video") a single butterfly, with enough detail to get the pose right.

### Anyways

I used a pen to ink the outlines, after that dried, I painted the butterfly with a layer of watercolors.

I had to pile some books and notebooks to support my phone in a repeatable distance above the page, with that I took pictures of each frame, about 60.

I used [Krita](https://krita.org/en/ "A free and open source painting program") to edit the few differences on lighting, and to align the frames. At the time krita didn't have the best tools for this but I didn't need much anyway.

## Result

I'm really proud that it loops seamlessly. Here's the gif:

### Like a week later

My sister was bored accompanying me in the living room, I asked her to draw me a cat, **now redraw that same cat 10 more times**. Then I did exactly the same as with the butterfly, it looks **really cute**.

I doubt she knows I still have this. According to the metadata of the files, we did this all on August 2020.
