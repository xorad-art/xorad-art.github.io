# Raintower

## An Indie Videogame Project

> 2025/05/03

One of my pastimes is every now and then checking on the projects of my discord friends or acquaintances, some of those are simple, others are more ambitious, and the one I've taken particular liking lately is **Raintower**.

It's an 2D RPG game inspired by [_The Hundred Line_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hundred_Line:_Last_Defense_Academy#) or [_Little Misfortune_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Misfortune), with all that side-scrolling exploration and movement, it is still in the works and I have very high hopes on where it can go.

_The Raintower team_ is full of interesting people and we've been working on many aspects of the game for a while (though I'm not sure how soon it's going to come out as a playable game).

> I have ended up doing some of my most ambitious illustrations with them because I enjoy it, and genuinely find the characters so lively even before I joined the team.

### The Story

I always picture something very ["_night in the woods_"-esque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_in_the_Woods) or even a little how the [_Hades_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hades_(video_game)) in-between-runs moments play from reading the game design document, but time will tell, [Watermelonis](https://www.instagram.com/watermelonis_153/) the creator of this whole thing is still determined on making it her magnum opus.

> The story follows a post-apocalyptic world where a girl in a yellow rain coat tries to find her lost little sister. Adventuring in an island along with the people she meets in this new place she's ended up shipwrecked

### My Impressions

I think around April of last year I found the project in a discord server and it had so much art of the characters, I could see how the illustrations were getting better through the two years raintower was there before I knew it existed through a small post in another different server. It was really inspiring to see.

I decided to make some fanart and slowly did my best to get included into the project as an artist, and also, I'm a programmer, I wanna see this getting done so I can play, and if that means helping with some drawings, or assets, or some code... "I could help with that".

Since then, there's been small bits of progress, most of us are busy with college or work, but these kinds of things bring me so much joy.

With **Hann** (@hannvco he doesn't have social media I can link) one of the other artists in the discord server we made this picture for Easter of this year, I love how it turned out.

I'm weirdly proud of it even though it was Hann's idea. I think neither of us would have drawn it this way if we were in our own; maybe that's the best part.
