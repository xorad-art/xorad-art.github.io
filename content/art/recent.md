### Art for Raintower

With an artist of the [Raintower project](art/rainTower.md), Hann and I made this illustration for Easter, with of course the only bunny girl of the cast.

### Drawing on Microsoft Paint

For some reason I decided to draw on Microsoft Paint. I saw some cool art on it and downloaded an old Windows XP version of it.

### Team Spiras

I drew a lot of character for a visual novel project I joined. It has been a lot of fun. They are sometimes a bit disorganized, but I like them.
