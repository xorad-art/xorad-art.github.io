## About

A small comic I made when my best friend told me about a guy that fell in love with one of our friends. I loved the idea of drawing it. We couldn't imagine anyone else as friendly and approachable as Samantha, anxiety just got the better of him.

I drew some of our classmates with the style, then, the whole week after, I drew this.

Writing this a year after, I hate some of the bubble layout so much, should make clearer that is written left to right... The original krita files should be somewhere, but doesn't matter, I will keep it as it is.

Every person on the comic consented for their depiction, except the bald teacher, which doesn't exist. Also, I'm not paying for hosting, so the bandwidth is limited, for the full resolution images, they are on [pixiv](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/109901868) and there's the [spanish version](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/109903505) too.

I found in the same file, the original sketches for the pages:
