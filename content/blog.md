## Projective Geometry

I made an [**introduction for projective geometry**](other/projectiveGeoIntro.md), it is rather heavy on math, but I'm proud of how it ended up:

<div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;">
    <iframe
        style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;"
        frameborder="0"
        width="100%"
        height="100%"
        allow="autoplay"
        src="media/projectiveGeoIntro/Pascals-theorem.html">
    </iframe>
</div>

## Some Linguistics is always nice

Let me tell you about the time I was [**Learning Japanese for a year**](other/learningJapaneseOneYear.md). Right now I'm a bit more confident about it, but there are so many things to learn when every word is new.

Or, if you want to know more about me, you can check my [**About page**](about.md).

I don't know, I'll write more stuff. I'm sure of it.
