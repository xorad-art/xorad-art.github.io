# A manga called Toybox

I feel like I'm an illustrator by trade, single drawings, small collections, but long term projects are always a nice addition, they can get really fun and interesting. In this case I started working with a Canadian writer for a few months, he posted an announcement looking for an artist in a discord server I liked to hang out at. He already had been thinking on a story for a couple of years, developing the characters, the worldbuilding, it was a surprisingly good story when I asked him about it.

Much of the preliminary work had been done by a young artist that had made a lot of the storyboards for the planned one-shot, I could start from those reworking some parts into a style that I found comfortable.

## Drawing takes time, a lot of it

From the viewpoint of an illustrator, getting into an equal standing relationship with a writer, both working on our craft for the love of it, is basically impossible unless the writer also draws. The hours you can put in for a section that took a few minutes to write are abysmal. I could not allow myself to such a time investment without being paid, even if modestly.

Even with people I trust, drawing takes re-working over ideas, sometimes trying to go back to it from a different angle, it takes a lot of time, for my closest friends I will usually take a token amount, enough for a pack of chips to eat while getting a drawing close to how they imagined it.
