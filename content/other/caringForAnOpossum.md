# Taking care of an Opossum

> **2024/09/07**

Right now, it has been two months since Erwin showed up, a baby opossum ([Didelphis virginiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_opossum "A North American opossum")), big enough to fall from his mom naturally, but he was injured, unable to walk, and, if we didn't find him, **the cats** would have.

He has been the cutest but messiest dude I've let live with me.

## How we got here

My dad found him, and he lived with my parents for a week, while being cared for by my sister he slowly recovered from what we think was a back injury, he would drag his hind legs and tail without moving either.

I met him when they brought him to a better-equipped vet, here in the city, where I had the most awkward interaction with a veterinarian ever.

> "Hey, we've been caring for this opossum for a while, we want a heads up of what to do about his injury, he previously didn't move his legs at all, has been getting a lot better, also an infection on his skin we want to treat"
>
> "Okay, " \*Puts him on table\* "Look, as you can see, he drags his legs. We can put him to sleep if you want"
>
> "Yeah, about that..."
>
> "I can recommend you this other place when you can put it to sleep"
>
> "Thanks for your help, we'll see what we can do"

You know what? I get it, you are completely desensitized to having people bring you random half-squashed animals, but, dude.

> Erwin did piss on him the moment he mentioned "putting him to sleep". For which, respect.

My dad was also pretty direct with it, he worked as a paramedic, opossum mortality is very high, but we've all agreed to see how far could he recover, **when he showed signs of progress** we finally gave him his name.

### And yes, he did recover

The week after the vet visit, he finally stopped dragging his legs. He recovered from the infection, which, left him a gaping wound, however, he also recovered from it, leaving just a small scar. Still, I can't say it's a complete recovery yet, he walks funny, but in a pinch, he will outrun me.

For anyone curious, he got his name because of another Erwin, [**Schrödinger**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger). He was long enough in a birdcage so that he didn't run wild, that there were Schrödinger's cat jokes.

And talking about that cage, that is also the reason that he's with me right now, It made sense to have him for a while in a cage while he was mice-sized, but we knew that he would outgrow it really quickly. My room was a very easy place for him to roam around without getting in any unreachable crevice or climbing anywhere dangerous. Also, I am, along with my sister, the only one that liked him enough to deal with his bullshit.

## Living with Erwin

He is not anything extravagant, he is not as messy as the messiest cat I've met, but there's a smidge, an itty bitty problem, **His grind begins at 11pm, and will end at 7am**

### He has his routine

I think he is a very industrious guy, the same way you may have your to-do list, he does his chores **every single day**. He will first come out of his hiding place to find food, any fruit, nut, insect, or vegetable, they are omnivores after all.

> After some taste tests, his favorite are **bananas**. Closely followed by guayabas and liver.

He enjoys hunting and foraging, and now that he trusts me more, I'll leave the door open so that he can leave and come back with a snail or cricket from outside.

He chose the place he felt most comfortable in, and will sleep there during the day. It's below some shelves I have, He will outgrow it too, but it's close to his litter box so he can walk there during the day without being scared of losing cover.

> Yes he learned to use a litter box like a cat, Sadly he uses it only like 80% of the time. But even then I'm proud of him.

### Opossum Engineering

After filling his stomach, he will continue with his second task, to find **only the best materials** for his house.

This was a thing that wouldn't have passed through my mind, he began grabbing paper and leaves with his tail to add to the insulation and feng shui of his hiding place, of course.

The first time I had an empty chips bag on the trashcan, he toppled the trashcan (because of the smell, I assume, he uses his nose so much more than his eyes), he began making so much noise trying to wrangle with the bag that I barely slept.

Since then, I've had to keep any piece of clothing away from the reach of his paws, I had found a t-shirt that is triple his size in there. Because he pretty much will look at anything like that as if he were in a store, grab it, stretch it, smell it,

> "Is this a 100% cotton?"

Then do a little juggle to pass it to his tail and continue shopping.

#### Did I tell you I had a piñata from last year's holidays?

It was below my bed, well, he liked the texture of the colored strips that were in it, and one morning I found them **everywhere**

## Would I recommend having an Opossum?

It definitely has been an experience, If you can deal with a raccoon, an opossum will be a breeze. The only reason he's still here is because he's still smaller than a rat, he definitely can't 1v1 even a cat yet, but hopefully, in a few weeks he may be back in the same area were his mom lives.

But even if they are really cute, if them not being domesticated doesn't give you enough of a red-flag, I will give you some extra points:

- They are omnivores, a healthy diet for them is similar to a healthy human diet, that means their shit smells **100%** human, I could you not, if you want to smell the experience of someone shitting on the floor, this is it.

- Even if Erwin learned that the litter box is somewhere he can go, he's the most comfortable when he can **climb somewhere** and shit **from there**. You can imagine the rest.

- They are rather solitary animals, they may, like, say "good morning" to other opossums but their social interactions end there. So they won't try and become your friend.

- They live short lives, up to 5 years in captivity, they will turn from cute to geriatric rather quickly.

- They have *two pairs* of **opposable thumbs**, any attempt to contain them is futile.

With all of this, I hope that Erwin continues to grow healthily to be released, even if he doesn't fear humans anymore, the area my parents live in doesn't have that many customs to hunt them or to cook them... I think, and unless you are walking in the dead of night, you are **never** going to find an opossum lives where you are anyways.
