# My journey learning Japanese

> **2024/02/19**

Linguistics has always been a subject interesting to me, I'm a native Spanish speaker, and with a horrid initial introduction to English, my troubles with that language inside a classroom became a motivation to learn on my own.

I've always been interested in learning Japanese, but, I never had good ways to overcome some of the initial barriers of learning it. Some friends of mine got stuck memorizing ひらがな (hiragana) or カタカナ (katakana), most of the time, they would give up after a few weeks, or just permanently stuck with 漢字 (kanji).

Reading is a big barrier for Japanese and Chinese with the thousands of characters and that, so learning through reading is a level far harder to reach.

## The Reasons

Language learning needs no justification, but I've always been interested in Japanese culture, sometimes being foreign enough for things to have no direct translation, and other being similar enough to be relatable. One of my main hobbies is reading comics, but most DC and Marvel comics are not my thing, they felt impersonal. The way a lot of manga is written and drawn just **gets me**. That became a good enough excuse to study properly.

I've been on and off learning Japanese for a while because of my [weaboo *inclinations*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanophilia) but just about **one year ago**, I decided to take it seriously. Each day, I would use my now unused time commuting to College, to learn Japanese. I eventually got to a point where I could read and understand manga and some light novels with furigana (kanji subtitles) while I'm getting better remembering kanji.

## The Resources

### Grammar

Thanks to an uncle that holds a shelf of language learning books, he lent me the [Complete edition](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11326669-living-language-japanese-complete-edition) for [**Living language**'s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Language) japanese books. I've been unable to find pirated pdfs of them, the company **doesn't even have a website anymore**, they've been bought by another company and now redirect to an english tutoring website I don't care about.

With those, I could omit trying to get through difficult things with other books like [Genki's](https://genki.japantimes.co.jp/index_en "A popular Japanese learning book") *"ask a classmate"* moments

> I don't have classmates, I'm sitting on the metro, and the people around me won't respond to a 「はじめましてショラッドです、ちんちは小さいです」.

[**Minna no nihongo**](https://ia600704.us.archive.org/33/items/MinnaNoNihongoIITrans/Minna%20no%20Nihongo%20I-Trans.pdf "A better option than Genki") was a better option for my situation, but having the other physical books felt better. If you want a quick overview of what it entails, [this article](https://www.fluentin3months.com/japanese-grammar/) is a good start.

### Kanji

Anki cards always felt bothersome to me, I saw someone using [**Kanji Study**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mindtwisted.kanjistudy "Another app for learning kanji") and I've been using it since. It's a great app, some of their features are locked behind a paywall, but the [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition "A bit of how memory works") system that it calls *guided study* was the only thing I needed.

### Vocabulary

There are a lot of apps, I don't care about them, including the green owl one, you [can do better](https://youtu.be/WXHtwQP9DnQ "A video about complementing duolingo") than just Duolingo, as long as you find something in Japanese than you can enjoy your time reading, watching or listening to, you're good to go.

> Diversify your sources, and you'll be fine. Read news papers, watch anime, documentaries, try and understand a song, watch a movie, play on an original rom of pokemon, even watch v-tubers if you are into that.

A dictionary like [**takoboto**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.takoboto "A dictionary app for Japanese"), it's always a great addition, free and easy to use.

If you are into legally sourced content some Youtube channels like [Dogen's](https://www.youtube.com/@Dogen "A comedy skits and grammar lessons channel"), a personal favorite of mine, or a broader selection of [youtubers Livakivi made a list of](https://youtu.be/TgGHJeqnucc "My 15 Favorite Japanese YouTubers For Learning Japanese") are a great place to start. There's Crunchyroll *(even if they recently killed Funimation and then jacked up their prices)*, Netflix and more.

But **who cares about those**; If I had to warn you about some sites and tools that usually have the stuff you want completely illegally and you definitely shouldn't use, I would tell you about these two:

- [**nyaa.si**](https://nyaa.si/ "A site for anime and manga torrents"), With any torrent you could search for, manga, anime and light novels, download and it's done. All raw in Japanese, if, you search in kanji.
- [**Ani-cli**](https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli "Their GitHub"), For the nerds that want to watch anime from the terminal. (Far better than any website)

## The Routine

I spend an hour and a half each day commuting to college, about the same going back home, with a 20 and a 30 minute stretches of time calm enough to read.

After about a week familiarizing with 仮名 (Kana, i.e. hiragana and katakana), I started with the grammar books and the kanji app. The first of books from living language is entirely in hiragana, the followings have kanji without furigana, so Kanji Study felt rewarding.

> It was interesting to learn, but also a bit of a chore. After some time of the habit, it became just another part of my day. Something I did when sitting on the metro.

I tried to write the lessons on a notebook, and I kept with it for a while, but I eventually stopped. I don't think it was a bad idea, but I didn't have the time to keep up with it.

This stretch of time of about 6 months, until getting to a point where I could read a manga and not need to check the dictionary every 5 seconds was the **hardest part**. As of today I still keep a tab open with Takoboto, but I don't need to check it as often. Reading manga on Japanese is finally a relaxing activity, even if far more taxing than reading in English.

I assure you, **my happiest day that year** was when I was reading Death Note; having watched the anime and loved it enough to know the story by episode. The moment I could go through **a single page** without needing to check the dictionary once, was an instant of pure bliss.

For anyone wondering I have finished Death Note until L's defeat.

> No, I don't care about the second part of the story. It isn't as good. The ending is great though.

## The Future

I'm not sure what I'll do with my Japanese, I'm not planning to move to Japan, but I'm sure I'll keep reading manga. I'm not much of a fan of light novels but I've loved novels like Tokyo Blues from Haruki Murakami, so I might give it a try eventually.

There are many, **many** things I have to improve:

- My **vocabulary** is **really limited**.
- My **speaking** is **terrible**, I can't hold a conversation.
- My writing is even worse, **I can't write** a sentence by hand without checking the dictionary, on keyboard I recognize enough kanji to just use it.
- My listening is not as bad, but **I can't understand a lot** of what I hear.

I have some heavier grammar books on my shelf but sometimes I'll find a wikipedia article that is more complete on Japanese than on English and I'll give it a try.

I'll keep learning it even if not as intensively studying because I feel like I understand enough to use the **language as a tool to learn as I go**. I'm not sure if I'll ever be fluent, but,

> I'm sure I'll keep learning. Also, 葬送のフリーレン (Sousou no Frieren) is being such a great read.
