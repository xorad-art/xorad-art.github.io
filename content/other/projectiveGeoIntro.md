## An Extension of Euclidean Space

**2025/11/24**

TODO

Projective Geometry is the study of geometric configurations under projective transformations, that is to say,
the study of distribution of points, lines, conics and planes when transformed by perspective or projections.

There's a lot of useful theorems that use perspective, 

On projective geometry we use (depending on how you see it) a type of an affine space or an extension of a 
euclidean space, using
